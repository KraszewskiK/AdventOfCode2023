This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenge for the year 2023.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, covering a variety of topics and difficulty levels. Participants solve these puzzles using their preferred programming language and share their solutions with the community.

## Tasks

The tasks for this year are available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Solutions

This repository is organized by day, with each day's solutions residing in its respective subdirectory in the [solutions/](solutions) directory. Each solution includes two code files (`task1.py` and `task2.py`). The input files are not included but can be obtained by supplying a `solutions/cookie.txt` file with your cookies from the events website.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use these solutions as a reference or inspiration for your own solutions.

## Directory Structure
